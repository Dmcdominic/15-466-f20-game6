## Command line arguments
Enviro is fullscreen by default, except for Linux, which is windowed by default. Use either of these args to override this:
```
    --windowed
    --fullscreen
```
Debugging tools can be enabled to display the level index and name, as well as to add two extra controls:
'n' to skip to the next level, 'p' to return to the previous level, and 'o' to return to the overworld.
```
    --debug
```
